I am a PhD-student at the <a href="https://compcommlab.univie.ac.at/">Computational Communication Science Lab</a> at the University of Vienna, and the Project Manager of the <a href="https://opted.eu">OPTED</a> project.<br/>

Below you can find a resume that was built in <a href="https://typst.app/">Typst</a>. Note that I know next to nothing about Typst.
