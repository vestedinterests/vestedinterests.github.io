Hi! I am Marvin Stecker.   
I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://compcommlab.univie.ac.at/">Computational Communication Science Lab</a> at the University of Vienna. I am part of the <a href="https://authlib.eu/">AUTHLIB</a> project on illiberal challenges to democracy, and previously worked in the <a href="https://opted.eu/">OPTED</a> project on infrastructures for political text analysis.

My research focuses on two broad areas: substantially I focus on social groups and their identities in the political space, focussing on their meaning, their contestation and influence on political behaviour. I am also interested in methodological questions, particularly around computational approaches such as natural language processing or simulation studies, and work on their development and validation.
