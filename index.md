Hi! I am Marvin Stecker.   
I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://compcommlab.univie.ac.at/">Computational Communication Science Lab</a> at the University of Vienna, working in the <a href="https://opted.eu/">OPTED</a> project on infrastructures for political text analysis. 
<div style="padding-top: 0.2%"></div>
I am interested in digital media and culture, politics and social inequalities and funky methods. I draw on quantitative and qualitative research methods, but mostly love everything computational, using natural language processing, network analysis and agent-based modelling.
