Hi! I am Marvin Stecker. I am pre-doctoral researcher at the <a href="https://compcommlab.univie.ac.at/">Computational Communication Science Lab</a> at the University of Vienna. I help to manage and contribute to the <a href="https://opted.eu">OPTED</a> project which works towards establishing an infrastructure for the analysis of political texts in Europe.<br/>

<!--I completed my Master's in Communication Science at the WWU University in Münster after spending a year abroad at the University of Salzburg as part of an Erasmus-exchange.-->
<!-- <h4>My background</h4> -->
While a communication scientist at heart, my background in sociology influences me to examine power structures, hiearchies and discrimination in politics and society. I investigate these topics, particulary their expression in (digital) media and culture, and connect them to topics such disinformation, political communiation and online discussions. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/BgBf6pW9qOgQU/giphy.gif" alt="drawing" align="left" width="15%" style="padding-right: 1%; min-width: 100px"/>Lastly, I am fascinated by questions around methodologies and epistemologies and how they intersect with research practices and the (re-)production of social inequalities, but also how these tools can be used to investigate these very phenomena.<br/>
I work with both qualitative and quantitive research methods, but I am especially interested in Computational Social Science. I've analysed texts with R, generated networks with Python and programmed turtles in NetLogo, but I will always dip my interested toes into what I need. Constantly on the lookout for fascinating new things to learn.

<h4>My philosophy</h4>
Equally, I am passionate about science communication and education. Teaching my own tutorium in my second Bachelor year was a scary but wonderfully rewarding experience. I believe in trying to make science accessible through clear, accessible communication. GIFs are never out of place when explaining Marxism or a research methodology, because breaking it down ≠ dumbing it down.  
I believe in honestly failing and learning through that. My own path when getting into a new topic is littered with <i>Whats, Hows</i> and <i>"... makes sense I guess?"</i>; only when I can admit that 'I don't get it' to a room without feeling like a failed human being can I actually make progress in understanding.
With that in place, the seminars I have enjoyed the most were the ones where lecturers challenged us on the work we presented or the readings we had prepared; where you had to put in the work to then be rewarded with the best class discussions we had. Accessible, never mean-spirited, but rigorous. -->

Equally, I am passionate about science education, skill-sharing and asking dumb questions. I love GIFs and StackOverflow and the kinds of examples that make use of a horse and three cucumbers. When I try anything new, I'll inevitably fail 300 times, and then once more. If you read this, and you have a question, or are interested in something, or just wanna say hello, hit me up!

In my spare time, I enthusiastically gush about baroque music and proudly love cheap, no-name chocolate.
