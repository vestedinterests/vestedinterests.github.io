Hi! I am Marvin Stecker. I am currently completing my Master's in Communication Science at the WWU University in Münster after spending a year abroad at the University of Salzburg as part of an Erasmus-exchange. My main topic of interest are social inequalities.  
<h4>My background</h4>
I am influenced by my background in Sociology which makes me interested in power structures, hiearchies and discrimination in politics and society. I have also explored the mental health and well-being consequences of digital media use. Lastly, I am fascinated by questions around methodologies and epistemologies and how they intersect with research practices and the (re-)production of social inequalities, but also how these tools can be used to investigate these very phenomena.

I am skilled and experienced with both qualitative and quantitive research methods that I have employed in various projects. A pet project of mine are applications of Computational Social Science. I am comfortable in R, which I have used for emotion detection and topic analysis tasks for research questions and will always dip my interested toes into Python or other tools I need.

<h4>My philosophy</h4>
Equally, I am passionate about science communication. Teaching my own tutorium in my second Bachelor year was a scary but wonderfully rewarding experience. I believe in trying to make science accessible through clear, accessible communication. GIFs are never out of place when explaining Marxism or a research methodology, because breaking it down ≠ dumbing it down.  
I believe in honestly failing and learning through that. My own path when getting into a new topic is littered with <i>Whats, Hows</i> and <i>"... makes sense I guess?"</i>; only when I can admit that 'I don't get it' to a room without feeling like a failed human being can I actually make progress in understanding.
With that in place, the seminars I have enjoyed the most were the ones where lecturers challenged us on the work we presented or the readings we had prepared; where you had to put in the work to then be rewarded with the best class discussions we had. Accessible, never mean-spirited, but rigorous.

In my spare time, I enthusiastically gush about baroque music and proudly love cheap, no-name chocolate. Fight me.
