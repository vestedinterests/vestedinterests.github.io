<h4>Emotion detection in R</h4>
I wrote a small, efficient tool to annotate text data using any available dictionary. It includes a helper function to shape input data into an efficient dictionary format and also a (very) primitive tokenisation. The goal is for it to be as versatile as possible.   
I am indebted to the great <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/index.html">syuzhet</a> package; however, limited ressources (personal laptops) meant we needed a much more efficient approach. By re-writing it I reduced the computation time by around 95% so that we could run the analysis on our local machines.

Before I publish the code on GitHub, I would like to do some polishing and proper documentation, but will happily share the code on request!
