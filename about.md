Hi! I am Marvin Stecker. I am currently completing my Master's in Communication Science at the WWU University in MÃ¼nster. My main topic of interest are social inequalities. I have also done some dives into cultural studies and Critical Theory, but please don't quote me on that.

I am skilled and experienced with both qualitaitive and quantitive research methods for various projects. A pet project of mine are applications of Computational Social Science. I am comfortable in R, and will always dip my interested toes into Python or other tools I need.

Equally, I am passionate about science communication. Teaching my own tutorium in my second Bachelor year was a scary but wonderfully rewarding experience. I believe in trying to make science accessible through clear, accessible communication. GIFs are never out of place when explaining Marxism or a research methodology. Breaking it down != dumbing it down.  
I believe in honestly failing and learning through that. My own path when getting into a new topic is littered with <i>Whats, Hows</i> and <i>"... makes sense I guess?"</i>; only when I can admit that 'I don't get it' to a room without feeling like a failed human being can I actually make progress in understanding.
With that in place, the seminars I have enjoyed the most were the ones where lecturers challenged us on the work we presented or the readings we had prepared; where you had to put in the work to then be rewarded with the best class discussions we had. Accessible, never mean-spirited, but rigorous.

In my spare time, I enthusiastically gush about baroque music and proudly love cheap, no-name-brand chocolate. Fight me.
